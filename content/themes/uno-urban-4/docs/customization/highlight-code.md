# Highlight Code

The code highlight is based in [Prism](http://prismjs.com/). By default, the languages supported are:

```
markup, css, c, javascript
```

If you want to support more languages:

1) go to [prismjs.com/download](http://prismjs.com/download.html),
2) generate your custom highlight code
3) paste in the [prism file](https://github.com/Kikobeats/uno-zen/blob/master/assets/scss/modules/_prism.scss)
3) compile the assets

Be careful, the current prism code is integrated with the color schema of the theme. You need to edit manually to get the correct look and feel.
